            Mandazi, an East African pastry, entices with its sweet, spiced allure. These fried dough treats, popular in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, are made from a blend of flour, sugar, and coconut milk or milk. The dough, infused with fragrant cardamom, is fried to a golden crispness, revealing a soft interior.
