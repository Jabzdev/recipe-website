        <p>
            East African chapati is a popular variation of the traditional Indian chapati, and it has been adapted to suit the tastes and culinary practices of East Africa.

            East African chapati is more than just a side dish; it's a culinary centerpiece. It's paired with a variety of flavorful dishes such as sukuma wiki (a dish made from collard greens), nyama choma (grilled meat), and various stews. 

            Its versatility shines as it can be enjoyed on its own or used to scoop up mouthfuls of flavorful accompaniments.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Prepare the Dough</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Add the oil and mix it into the flour using your fingertips. This helps create a crumbly texture</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Gradually add water in small amounts while kneading the mixture into a soft and pliable dough. The dough should not be too sticky or too dry. Adjust water as needed.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Divide and Shape</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Divide the dough into golf ball-sized portions. Roll each portion between your palms to make smooth balls.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Lightly coat each ball with a bit of oil, then cover them with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let them rest for about 15-20 minutes. This resting period helps relax the gluten and makes rolling easier.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Rolling and Layering</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Take one oiled ball of dough and flatten it slightly with your fingers.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>On a clean, flat surface, roll out the dough ball into a thin circle using a rolling pin. It's common to sprinkle a bit of flour to prevent sticking.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Brush the rolled-out circle with a thin layer of oil or ghee.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Fold the oiled circle in half to form a half-moon shape.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Brush the half-moon with oil again and fold it once more, this time creating a triangle shape.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Repeat for Remaining Dough</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Repeat the rolling, oiling, and folding process for the rest of the dough balls.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Final Rolling</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Take one folded triangle and gently roll it out into a larger triangle. Be careful not to press too hard to maintain the layers.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Cooking</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Heat a pan or skillet over medium heat. You can use a non-stick pan or a traditional cast iron skillet.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Place the rolled chapati onto the heated pan and cook for about 1-2 minutes on each side. As it cooks, you should see small bubbles forming.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Brush a little oil or ghee on each side of the chapati while cooking. This helps it cook evenly and gives it a nice golden color</dd>
