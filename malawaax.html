        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Somali Malawax, a cherished delicacy, embodies the rich culinary heritage of Somalia. These thin, crepe-like pancakes are made from a batter of flour, milk, sugar, and sometimes eggs. After a brief resting period, the batter is poured onto a hot griddle, creating golden rounds that are soft and slightly spongy.

            Malawax's taste balances sweetness with a touch of tang, and its versatility shines as it can be paired with a variety of accompaniments, from ghee to honey. Often enjoyed during breakfast or special occasions, Malawax captures the essence of Somali culture through its flavors and the joy it brings to shared meals.

            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Prepare the Batter</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, water, eggs, and melted butter or ghee until well combined.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients while whisking. Mix until you have a smooth batter with no lumps. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter. If needed, adjust the amount of milk or water to achieve the right consistency.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the batter rest for about 30 minutes. This helps improve the texture of the Malawax.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Heat the Pan</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat. You can lightly grease the pan with a small amount of oil to prevent sticking, but it's not necessary if you're using a non-stick pan.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Cook the Malawax</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Give the batter a quick stir before cooking. It might have thickened during the resting time, so adjust the consistency with a little water if needed.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Ladle a small amount of batter into the center of the pan. Immediately start spreading it in a circular motion using the back of the ladle. The batter should spread into a thin, round shape.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Fry the Malawax</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Cook the Malawax for a few minutes on one side until you see small bubbles forming on the surface and the edges starting to lift. The bottom should be golden brown.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Carefully flip the Malawax to the other side using a spatula, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the second side is also golden brown and cooked through.</dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <dt>Repeat</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Transfer the cooked Malawax to a plate, and cover it with a clean cloth to keep them warm and prevent drying out.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the pan as needed to prevent sticking.</dd>
